Project no: 6

Project due date: 12/13/2017

Project description: Final programming project - Restart, God mode, Conclusion

The easiest part of this project: Restart Game

Problems that I had in completing this project: Painters algorithm, Sasuke(Enemy)

Requirements satisfied:

1) pbharad.mp4 is present

2) Music for the game, bullet and collision is added

3) 
* The game starts with our hero Naruto who kills a bunch of Gara(typical) and make his way over to meet his arch enemy Sasuke. If Naruto touches Gara/Sasuke, then his health decreases and shooting Sasuke will decrease the health of Sasuke shown on the screen. Sasuke keeps shooting Naruto and if the bullet hits Naruto, health of Naruto decreases. 

* The color of the health for both Player(Nauto) and Enemy(Sasuke) changes after the health is less than 50%. If the health of Naruto is 0, then the game is lost. If the health of Sasuke is 0, then the game is lost.

* Pressing W+D will jump right, W+A will jump left

* Painters algorithm which flies aeroplane in different sizes and distances. 

4) Does not crash as tested in my PC

5) 
* Pressing R will restart the game

* Pressing G will have God mode for the game

* F-1 has the help option with ability to view Free List and Bullet List
