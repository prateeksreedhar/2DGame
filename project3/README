Project description: Tracking a Sprite, Multisprite and TwoWayMultipSprite

The easiest part of this project: Conversion of loops

Problems that I had in completing this project: Segmentation faults due to incorrect partitioning of frames, memory leaks due to non deletion of sprites vector and tracking more than two sprites.

Requirements satisfied:

1) Conversion of while loops to ranged for loops(ParseXML::displayData(), Gamedata::displayData())

	parseXML.cpp ->  Lines 38 to 41
	gamedata.cpp ->  Lines 75 to 77

2) Convert the first 3 ranged for loops in the ImageFactory destructor to while loops without using auto.

	imageFactory.cpp -> Lines 13 to 30

3) Convert ImageFactory from a GoF singleton into a Meyers singleton.

	Can be verified in imageFactory.h and imageFactory.cpp

4) Use IOmod and C ++ stringstreams to write the fps of your game to the screen, and write your name
in the lower left corner of the screen.

	engine.cpp -> Lines 54 to 57

5) Add generality to IOmod by permitting the user to write text in a different color font.

	ioMod.h -> Line 12
	ioMod.cpp -> Line 51

6) Parallax Scrolling
	Can be verified from the animation

7) Use delete to “explicitly disallow compiler generated functions” in Engine , and ImageFactory .

	engine.h -> Lines 16-17
	imageFactory.h -> Lines 17-18

8) Convert the current tracker framework into a coherent animation, using as many sprites as you need.
Store all sprites in a polymorphic vector of Drawable*.

	Coherent animation -> As seen in the video pbharad.mp4
	Storing Sprites : 
	engine.h -> Line 29
	engine.cpp -> Lines 21 to 25

9) Extend your animation, and this vector, to contain a third type of spite: a two-way multi-frame sprite.

	twoWayMultisprite.h
	twoWayMultisprite.cpp

10) Your submission must contain no memory leaks in user code.

	Verified with valgrind

11) A video of your animation.

	Name of the video: pbharad.mp4. I used Simple Screen Recorder.
